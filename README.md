# Vue-ToDoApp

This project is a simple to-do list application. In this project, you can create an account, login to your account, create to-do lists (and perform other CRUD operations), and write items to your lists while seeing the item's current status: whether is completed or ongoing. 

This project uses Fastify framework on backend, and Vue JS framework on frontend. The project also includes the dockerized version of the backend.

In order to operate fast searching, a basic implementation for Solr (https://solr.apache.org/) is included in the project.
